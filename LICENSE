Anyone may reproduce, distribute and communicate this license to the public if not altered in any way.

Preamble

The purpose of this MuSofT License (hereinafter referred to as the "License") is to enable the non-commercial use for research and education purposes in schools and universities. The License addresses primarily persons wishing to make their copyright protected works available for non-commercial purposes in research and education in schools and universities without requiring the user to acquire rights for every use. Additionally, it also addresses persons wishing to reproduce, distribute and modify a work which may be used under the terms and conditions of this license. 

The License grants the user the right to use the work in all known modes of exploitation as well as the right of modification of the work in any way is granted. The moral rights of the author are respected by the License, since it is one of its aims to appropriately acknowledge the author's creative efforts and the efforts of those who enjoy neighboring rights and to protect their intellectual interests. The author shall be linked to his work by the requirement of a copyright notice or - in case of modifications of the work - by making reference to him within the work's history.

One of the main purposes of this License is to enable the modification of already existing works. Texts, databases, multimedia works and other kinds of content are often created through a co-operation of a multitude of persons. This is either because the work shows an increased degree of complexity, so that only one person is not able to develop it, or because the work needs to be updated, something that cannot be accomplished by the original author alone. The MuSofT license offers a model for the development and distribution of works created by several persons who are not combined in the sense of an organized entity. This License, however, may also be applied to any differently motivated release of works.

In order to enable a free modification by others, it is essential to provide not only the legal essentials, but also the technical prerequisites for an alteration. Digital works or works transferred into digital form have to be provided in a format which enables technically what is granted legally under this License.

The MuSofT License protects the licensor by means of the fact that no licensee may restrict the use of the work, even when modified. This is provided by the "Copyleft" effect, which secures that a work made subject to this license and its modified versions may only be used under the terms of this license.

The MuSofT license was created for the university project "MuSofT - Multimedia in der Software Technik" (MuSofT - Multimedia in Software Technology) which was supported by the German ministry for Education and Research. The license was used in this project for the first time.





1. Conclusion of the License Agreement

(a) This license text is an offer for the conclusion of a license agreement under the conditions as set forth in the following provisions. The offer is directed towards anyone. The license agreement shall be concluded by use of the rights provided in Sections 2 and 3, including, without limitation, reproducing or distributing the work. The user shall be hereinafter defined as the Licensee.

(b) The conclusion of this agreement is not needed for the mere use of a work, e.g. for privately listening to audio works, reading of a book or looking at a photo. This also applies in accordance with statutory copyright limitations, e.g. the creation of a back-up copy and the further passing on of a lawfully obtained reproduction of the work.


2. Grant of Licenses

(a) Upon conclusion of this license agreement, Licensee shall have the non-exclusive worldwide and perpetual right to use the work for research and education purposes in schools and universities in its original version. The use for other purposes is forbidden. This includes the right to use the work in digital and analogue format, online and offline, physically and non-physically. The permission to use is free of any charge.

(b) This License includes the right to reproduce, to distribute, to make the work available for download or to make the work otherwise available to the public, to perform or to communicate the work to the public in any other way.

(c) Any user of the work is not allowed to charge license fees as consideration for granting the license to make use of the work. 

(d) The licenses granted hereunder may not be transferred to third parties. Third parties may acquire licenses by means of the conclusion of a license agreement with the original author or the respective owners of exclusive rights. For this purpose, it is sufficient that third parties obtain the work together with the text of this license from any other third party and that a license agreement is concluded in accordance with Section 1.

3. Right to Modify

(a) Licensee has the right to modify the work and make use of the modified version as set forth in Section 2. This includes the right to abbreviate the work, to add new components, to replace parts of it or alter and modify the work in any other way. The work may be placed into another context and have its textual statement changed.

(b) Modifications may not impede the author's intellectual or personal interests. In this regard it has to be respected that granting licenses under the terms of this agreement shall enable substantial modifications of the work, because the possibility to alter the work is a main purpose of this License.

(c) In case of modifications the work's title has to be changed. For this purpose, it is sufficient to add supplementary part to the title which marks modifications of the work, for example the addition of a new version number. The title may not be changed if the work is used without modifications.

(d) It is recommended to add for each alteration a copyright notice to the already existing notices.


4. Release of Modifications and Neighboring Rights ("Copyleft")

(a) Whoever obtains a copyright when modifying a work shall make this copyright subject to this License, in the event the modified work is distributed, made available for download, made available in any other way, performed or communicated to the public in any other way.

(b) A modification, alteration or adaptation shall not be given, if the unmodified work
	
- 	is combined with another independent work. This shall also apply if the combined works are used as an entire work, 
- 	is included in a database or in a collected edition, or
- 	is a database or a collected edition and further elements are added.

In these cases a notification shall be provided stating which elements of the entire work or collected edition are subject to this License.

(c) An independent work is a work which can be reasonably used alone or which is customarily regarded as independent.

(d) Whoever obtains a neighboring right by making use of the work, for example a database producer right or the right pertaining to an interpretation of the work, shall make this right subject to the terms of this License, if the work is distributed, rented out, made available for download or otherwise made available to the public, performed or communicated to the public in any other way and if the neighboring right is required for such modes of use.


5. Moral Rights, Copyright Notice

(a) If the unmodified work is distributed, made available for download or otherwise made available to the public, performed or communicated to the public in any other way, the author's and interpreter's names shall be included in an unaltered way. The names and notices have to be presented appropriately according to the respective method of use.

(b) If a modified work is distributed, made available for download or otherwise made available to the public, performed or communicated to the public in any other way, the author's and interpreter's names shall not be presented outside the work's history without express consent. Translations of a work shall be deemed as modifications. In case of mere formal alterations the names shall be included according to the provisions applying to unmodified works. Spelling corrections, formatations or digitalization shall be deemed as such formal alterations.

(c) In case the names of authors or interpreters may not be presented due to modifications of the work, notifications as to the names of the authors and/or interpreters of the original version shall be appropriately made for each use. An appropriate notification is given if the history meets the requirements as set forth in Section 8, or if a footnote provides for the names in connection with the phrase "based upon the work of ...".

(d) The aforesaid provisions as to copyright notices shall apply accordingly to owners of exclusive rights in case they are named in connection with the work.


6. Making Available of Digital Data

(a) Whoever distributes, makes available for download or makes otherwise available to the public, performs or communicates the unmodified work to the public in any other way, shall provide the digital data of the work needed for further modifications if he has obtained such data together with the work.

(b)  Whoever distributes, makes available for download or makes otherwise available to the public, performs or communicates a modified version of the work to the public in any other way, shall provide the digital data necessary for further modifications in the exact data format which has been used for the modifications themselves. If no digital data was used for the modification or use of the work, there shall be no obligation for providing such data.

(c) For further modifications, such digital data are needed as used for creating or modifying the original work. If the work is converted into another data format, the original format shall be provided in case the new format does not enable further modifications.

(d) The making available of digital data shall be accomplished by:

- 	passing on the data carrier,
- 	publishing the work in a freely accessible data network and citing this source in the work or its history, or
- 	providing easy access to the data in any other appropriate way.

(e) Making digital data available may be omitted in accordance with Section 7 (b).
 

7. Other Obligations

(a) In case of the use in a physical form a copy of this License or the internet URL (by hyperlink etc.), under which the text of this License can be permanently retrieved, shall be provided. In the event of a non-physical presentation of the work the provision of the license text may be omitted, if this has to be deemed inappropriate. This may apply to oral presentations or performances, as well as to television and radio broadcastings.

(b) Notices regarding the applicability of this License as well as copyright notices may not be changed or deleted. Where including such a notice would be unreasonable, it may be omitted, for example in radio broadcasts which are transmitted terrestrially, via cable or satellite or if the work is used in a television commercial.

(c) The use of a work may not be made contingent upon the fulfillment of obligations, which are not expressly included in this License.

(d) Whoever obtains other intellectual property rights or neighboring rights in connection with his use of the work, including, without limitation, patents, trade marks and/or design rights, shall not impose additional obligations for making use of the work. Thus it shall not be allowed to apply for patent protection for modifications of the work and to establish conditions for the use of the modified work that go beyond the provisions of this License.

(e) The use of the work may not be made subject to technological measures, such as copy-protection systems or equivalent mechanisms, nor may the inclusion of such systems impede the use of a work, unless the work is provided without such a mechanism at the same time.


8. History

(a) The history shall include information on the work, for example on the title, the author and other proprietors, the publishing date and modifications of the work.

(b) If added to the work, the history must be passed on when work is used. Section 7 (a) applies.

(c) If a history is not included, a history shall be created and passed on upon using a modifying the work. The history shall at least contain information about the work, that are contained the work itself or which have been obvious upon receipt of the work. In this case Section 7 (a) shall apply.

(d) If a work is modified, it must be stated as clearly as possible within the history, where the modifier has acquired the original work. The provision of an internet URL is sufficient. The date of modification shall be stated within the history. Modifications of the work may be briefly commented within the history.

(e) If the owner of a right requests to be informed prior to the use of his work, for instance in order to be able to provide an updated version of the work, he may include such a notice in the history. It is recommended to comply with such a request.

(f) The history may only be changed in accordance with this Section.


9. Termination of Rights upon Violation, Breach or Infringement

(a) Any violation, breach or infringement of or upon this License automatically terminates the rights and licenses granted hereunder.

(b) Rights and licenses granted to third parties prior to the violation, breach or infringement shall remain in full effect.


10. Liability and Warranties

(a) Licensor's liability shall be restricted to the liability for fraudulent concealment of lack of title.

(b) This liability notification only refers to the granting of rights under this License. Liability and warranty obligations for other services, e.g. for the distribution of copies of the work, shall be governed by statutory provisions or individual agreements.


11. New Versions of this License

The Kompetenznetzwerk Universit‰tsverbund MultiMedia NRW may update this License in cooperation with the project MuSofT as much as necessary due to modifications of the legal or factual background. The Licensor confers the drafting and the determination of such updates upon the Kompetenznetzwerk Universit‰tsverbund MultiMedia NRW. The applicability of the updated provisions shall be constituted upon publication of the terms of the License. Future versions shall comply with the basic principles of this License. If a work is not expressly connected to a certain version of the License, the latest version shall apply.
